State Management: Track board, turn, selected, moveHistory, status, gameOver, and winner using React state.

Move Validation: Use helper functions (isValidMove, isInCheck, hasAnyLegalMove) to ensure legal chess logic.

Endgame Detection: After each move, check for checkmate, stalemate, or insufficient material (isOnlyKings).

UI Logic: Always render exactly 64 cells. Reset highlights and selections cleanly.
